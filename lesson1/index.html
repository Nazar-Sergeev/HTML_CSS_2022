        The Simpsons are the main protagonists of the TV show The Simpsons.
        The family first appeared on The Tracey Ullman Show, in the comedy short Good Night.
        The family has hundreds of relatives, including Mr. Burns and Patty and Selma.

        The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The
        Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa,
        and Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they
        were created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members,
        substituting "Bart" for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show
        short "Good Night" and were later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December
        17, 1989.

        Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family.
        The most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and
        Selma Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include
        Homer's mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other
        minor relatives.
